Note: 
This github repository contains the main parts of the analysis described below. Nevertheless, as this was a collaborative effort, additional methods or steps that could be potentially missing here, can be viewed at https://github.com/vkorobeynyk/scRNA-seq_analysis_jessberger_lab 

## Aim

Transcriptional comparison between Gli1- and Ascl1- targeted neuronal stem cells (NSCs) isolated from the adult mouse hippocampus.

## Repository structure

Tasks (`01`, `02`, etc) subfolders contain both source code in R (`Rmd` files) and the rendered HTML reports.

- `data`, processed data / annotations.
- `01_jaeger_descriptive`, scater's QC; Seurat's integration, dimensionality reduction and clustering.
- `02_mapping`, STAR + featurecounts + velocyto workflow to retrieve count matrices and velocyto's loom files.
- `03_diff_expression`, differential expression analysis (Seurat-based).
- `04_velocyto`, `velocyto.R`-based run.
- `05_prediction`, Machine Learning approach to predict Gli vs Ascl cells 

## Requirements

Mapping and other computer intensive tasks were run on a multicore 64-bits linux machine. Data analysis was carried out in R v3.6.1. A shortlist of the package versions include:

```
cutadapt v1.16
sickle v1.33
STAR v2.6.0c
subread v1.6.2 (featurecounts)
velocyto.py v0.17.17
caret v6.0.84
```
